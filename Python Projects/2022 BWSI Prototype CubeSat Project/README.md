Through MIT Bevaorworks, I was given a wonderful opportunity to build and program a prototype mini-satellite also known as a CubeSat. In this project, I created a hardware-integrated Python program and simulation with a team that detects, calculates, and indicates where on the map there are simulated red algae blooms. To make this CubeSat come to life, I worked with Raspberry Pis, IMUs, Raspberry Pi NoIR cameras, solar panels, image processing software, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code. Additionally, I was mentored by professionals who work in the industries of rocket propulsion, systems engineering, aeronautics, and astronautics on how to build the most efficient and productive CubeSat.
