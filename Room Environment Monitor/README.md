In Short: A prototype embedded hardware/software system that reads temperature and humidity, and flags said environmental conditions with LEDs 
(red for ranges that trigger a personal skin issue). Integrated an Arduino, DHT11 sensor, and LCD display to show real-time readings.


Still a work in progress as this is a project I've been continuously tweaking in my free time when I get the chance to! Only publishing the solid code as I still working
on the sensor data retrieval from scratch part, so currently this code uses third party libraries.
